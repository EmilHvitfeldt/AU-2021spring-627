We will continue the topic of pre-processing from last week and see how it related to PCA (chapter 10 in "An Introduction to Statistical Learning") and PCA regression (chapter 6.3).

[recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/) will be introduces as the R package we will use to perform pre-processing. Please read [this vvignette](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/articles/Simple_Example.html) on introducing recipes. We will also talk about the  [workflows](https://workflows.tidymodels.org/), no reading required.
