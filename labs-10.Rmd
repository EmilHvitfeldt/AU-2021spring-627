```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This week we will talk about shrinkage and hyperparameter tuning.

We will use the `Hitters` data set from the `ISLR` library. It can be loaded using the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
data("Hitters")
```

Remove all rows where the salary is `NA` and split the data into testing and training data sets.


a. Use `linear_reg()` with  `mixture = 0` to specify a ridge regression model.
b. Fit the model on the data and inspect the model. What do you see?
c. Try to predict using this model. What are your output?
d. Use {tune} to setup hyperparameter tuning to determine the right amount of regularization.
e. Fit the best model. How does your parameter estimates look like?
