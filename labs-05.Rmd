```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Create a test-train `rsplit` object of `mlc_churn` using `initial_split()`. Use the arguments to set the proportions of the training data to be 80%. Stratify the sampling according to the `churn` variable.

a. Create a LDA model specification.
b. Create a 10-fold cross-validation split object.
c. Fit the model within each of the folds.
d. Extract the performance metrics for each fold.
