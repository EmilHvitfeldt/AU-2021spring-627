title: "Lab 7 - clustering"
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We will be using the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) data set for this lab.

You will also be needing to load the [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(broom)
```

a. Transform the data set into a matrix using two of the numeric variables
b. Perform k-means using 3 clusters
c. Look at the result object with `summary()`, `names()`, and `str()`.
d. Use `augment()`, `glance()` and `tidy()` to extract information from the model
e. Plot the clusters with your package of choice
f. Rerun The previous steps with more variables and different values of $K$
g. Construct an Elbow Chart to find an appropriate number of clusters for the data set
