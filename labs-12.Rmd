We will be using this lab to explore decision trees and random forests using the `palmerpenguins` package. We will also use a couple of other packages such as `rpart.plot`, `rpart`, `ranger`, and `vip`.

a. Fit a decision tree using `decision_tree()`, and visualize the structure of the tree.

b. Try different values of the hyperparameters for the tree and see how the shape of the tree changes.

c. Use the `vip` package to showcase the variable importance.

d. Fit a random forest model using `rand_forest()`. What Do you see in the output?

e. Use the `vip` package to showcase the variable importance for the random forest.
