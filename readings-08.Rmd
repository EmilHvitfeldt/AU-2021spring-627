We are having [Wellness Week](https://www.american.edu/provost/communications/november-17-2020.cfm). I'll be talking about feature engineering and the value of pre-processing. There will be no reading this week.

If you find the subject of this lecture, you should check out the book [Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models](http://www.feat.engineering/) by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson.
